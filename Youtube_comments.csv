2,@muneebahmad3024,"1. Don't chase FAANG jobs
2. Learn the basics
3. Get real world experience by building professional projects
4. Networking"
3,@bigyang5847,"The best companies to start are usually the middle of the pack, already established on the market companies. These are the companies that do public transport apps, those who offer outsourcing, those who make insurance software. You can go through many different project inside such a company, without the immense pressure of fangg companies, and without the financial risk of startups. Literally the best of both worlds"
4,@brickie9816,I love how every single lesson can be applied not to just programming but to probably every field
5,@charlescramer8907,I don’t think you realize that you just gave people a blueprint to improve their life. Take these concepts and apply it to anything else and it will work. I love how open ended/general you left these topics in general and not just programming.
6,@Yipper64,"8:52 I really like specifically programming character controllers for videogames. If I had to get the most specific, that's my favorite part. Just making the character move how its supposed to. I may not be amazing at it but every time I add something to a character controller and then it works, I just love that immediate feedback."
7,@JoseA_CT,"I recently dropped out of college, I started studying physics but soon realized it was not for me. After some ""what the hell am I going to do with my life"" sleepless nights, I was like ""What if I try programming?"" I've always been interested in learning something but never really took that step, and so here I am now, starting my journey in this amazing field. I started with python and learnt some basics and also learnt some backend basics and how to work with an API (real basics obv), now I'm learning Java since that's what I'll need for school next year and I'm actually loving Java, I'm finishing the very basics of syntax and I can't wait to get my hands on GUI, more backend and even mobile apps."
8,@andrewclarke8163,Having a mentor has made the biggest difference for me. We met at jiu-jitsu. Didn't even realize he was a dev until a year into our friendship.

14,@bethanye.3352,"I've been in college for Information Technology for almost a year now. I am ADHD with meds. A lot of the basic stuff that I've been introduced to has kind of just flown over my head because of my learning issues. But, I know that this field is something I want to really invest my time into. As long as I can remember, I've been on a computer. Most of my happiest moments in life were taking apart and (failing to) put together my old Windows computers. As I jump into the inner most aspects of technology, I realize that it's going to be very difficult. Finding your videos feels like I struck gold. You explain things in a way that makes it easy for me to understand and I really appreciate that about you! You have gained a sub today and I'm looking forward to watching more of your videos as I continue through college and beyond :D"
15,@MrPulka100,"From all of those advices, I especially love one. And this one applies to everything, and life in general: ENJOY THE JOURNEY.
Seriously, relax, be happy right now with what you do and where you are because that's what's great about life and programming - well... the life and programming. :D"
16,@yanmifeayeni6373,"I just started learning c# and I relate to a lot of things said in the video. The imposter syndrome I face at my workplace really affects my confidence. After watching this video I realize that I just have to stay dedicated to my own journey. I was thinking that one day I’ll become a master but after watching this I realize I’m so wrong. Thank you so much for this video, I know have renewed confidence that I can be a backend developer one day"

52,@ayberk272,"Great videos, great humor. Keep it up!"
53,@Farzeezy,My tip: Add buffer to your estimates and be firm. You will try to be convinced to lower estimates to either lower cost or simplify resource management. It's okay to estimate higher than what you might think is the right number. Delivering something shouldn't be a speedrun. What you deliver should be made with care and consideration.
