# Youtube Scraping and Comment Sentiment Analysis
 Webscraping || Sentiment Analysis || AI || Python || FastAPI || Selenium

In this projcet we figured out how to Scrape comments from YouTube 
and extract the comments and authors into a CSV file 
(Use YouScraTes4.py if you want it to work)

the file created (if not existing already) will be called "Youtube_comments.csv" 
you can edit the file name and other parameters in the "database.py", "models.py" and "Main.py" to specify your own database and filenames/passwords

Use the .ipymb file in google colab for the sentiment analysis
